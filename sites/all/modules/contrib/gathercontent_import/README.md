# GatherContent Import #

This module allows you to quickly import content from your GatherContent projects into your Drupal site.

GatherContent is an online platform for pulling together, editing, and reviewing website content with your clients and colleagues. It's a reliable alternative to emailing around Word documents and pasting content into your CMS. This module replaces that process of copying and pasting content and allows you to bulk import structured content, and then continue to update it in Drupal with a few clicks.

Connecting a powerful content production platform, to a powerful content publishing platform.

Content can be imported as any sort of node content type. And you can choose to create new items etc. or overwrite existing entities.

The module allows you to specifically map each field on your items in [GatherContent](https://gathercontent.com) to various fields in Drupal, these include; title and any field your content type may have. It also allows you to directly embed images and files.
